# Welcome to Code Network!
Code Network is a student-led club based at QUT dedicated to fostering a strong,
inclusive community for anyone interested in code.

We were founded in 2015 to create a feedback loop between successful and
aspiring software engineers. Our club is a place where experienced programmers give
back so beginners can aim higher. **Build anything, as long as it's awesome**
is our motto and the mindset that guides everything we do.
