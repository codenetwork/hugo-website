# Safe Space Policy
Code Network is and always will be a safe and inclusive space for everyone. We
believe that in the absence of true equality in our world, we should aim to
provide equity to those who need it.

Abuse, discrimination, harassment, assault, sexism, racism, ableism, religious
persecution or homophobic behaviour of any kind is not tolerated in the Code
Network community. This includes events, discussions and online communications.
Any other behavior which would reasonably make a person feel trivialised or
otherwise discriminated against is also prohibited. If you violate this policy
you could be asked to leave our community either temporarily or permanently.

Abuse, discrimination, harassment and anything else mentioned above is not
tolerated in this group. Anyone violating this policy may be asked to leave our
community either temporarily or permanently. Please question in advance your
capacity to deal with being asked to leave if necessary and how you would react
in a progressive way if you were called out for behaviour in violation of this
policy.

Alcohol and other drugs are not an excuse for bad behaviour. We recognise the
difficulties imposed by mental health and/or other disabilities, but these
issues are not an excuse for poor behaviour either. Everyone can expect to be
held accountable for their behaviour equally. We ask that you be aware of your
capacity to remain in control of your emotions, actions and reactions when these
things come into play.

If you experience or witness any behaviour that crosses the boundaries, ideas or
intentions in this policy, challenge them. If you act contrary to this policy,
expect to be challenged. This means every time someone acts contrary to this
policy, pull them up on it. Be polite but firm, and explain why their behaviour
is not ok.

1. We all take part in the Code Network community with a commitment to mutual
respect, aid, anti-oppression advocacy, conflict resolution, non-violence and
community building.

2. We respect everyone’s names, preferred gender pronouns, expressed identities
and experiences. We avoid making assumptions, promote mutual appreciation and
understand that no one is required to share information about their identities
or experiences.

3. We support the empowerment of each person and strive to continually
acknowledge the histories and structures of oppression that marginalize some and
divide us all.

4. We commit to making our community as accessible as possible; physically,
socially, and personally.

5. We do not engage in violence or threats.

6. We obtain explicit consent for physical contact or using others’ belongings.

7. We recognise that certain behaviour and language can act as a trigger for
individuals, such as trivialising, joking about or dismissing someone’s thoughts
or experiences.

8. We believe in stepping back and letting people and groups explain and
conceive their own needs and requirements, and respect their choices and
experiences.

9. We accept a shared responsibility where we hold ourselves and one another
accountable to these agreements, without violence, judgment, or assumption of
intent.

10. We support the concept of freedom of speech, and aim to avoid all forms of
censorship. However, we do not support freedom from consequence. Your free
speech may incur consequences such as (but not limited to) moderation, being
included in a dispute process, temporary or permanent exclusion from our
community, etc.

11. We promote inclusive learning spaces. We encourage anyone who is feeling
less than familiar with terminology, concepts or context to ask questions in the
spirit of personal growth and learning.

## Terminology
Code Network defines various terms in our safe space policy as such:

### Oppression
A system of power that seeks to keep people separate and subordinate based on diversity or diversities from the mainstream authority. Also known as systematic discrimination of a group.

### Sexism
Oppression of a group of people based on their gender or sex.

### Racism
Oppression of a group of people based on their race, ethnicity or culture.

### Ableism
Oppression of a group of people based on their ability or disability to perform certain tasks.

### Homophobic Behaviour
Oppression of a group of people based on their sexual orientation or preferences.

### Religious Persecution
Oppression of a group of people based on their religious views.

### Discrimination
Prejudicial treatment of an individual or group based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain oppressed group or category.

### Cisgender
A person whose gender identity matches with the sex they are designated at birth.

### Trigger
A topic, phrase or word that emotionally sets someone off. Could refer to anger, or reliving a traumatic experience. They are not the same as being reminded of something someone does not like, or take offense to.
